**Digital and Social Media Strategies**: understanding how to reach and engage with consumers via digital technologies and social media

Managers propose **strategic questions** that need to be answered 

* Needs be answered $\implies$ can be **quantified with a number**
* And the number needs to be **credibly constructed** ...
* ... from **correct statistical analysis** of the **right data**

$\implies$ this course has a *substantial* quantitative component

# Textbooks & Readings

* **No Textbook** for the class
  * Become outdated fast as the digital space changes rapidly
  * Some emphasise too much of the hype, remainder are too dry
  * I do like Aral's *'Hype Machine'* though ... but its audience is not quite this class

* **Our job**: filter through the sea of information and teach what is useful and relevant
  * No hype, hopefully not too dry

* **Your job**: read over assigned papers & articles, learn the skills
  * We've curated course content to (hopefully) deliver the most insight with the least technical details
  * Readings shouldn't be 'hype', occasionally dry
  * Skills acquired should be easy to transfer to a different problem

* Course content will be on Canvas as PDFs before class

# Building an Analytics Toolkit

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="20%"}
url <- "figs/toolkit.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Delivering **good** _data driven_ answers to strategic questions $\implies$ using the right statistical techniques 

* ANOVA 
* Linear regression 
* Field Experiments
* Interpreting the results _carefully_

The 'right' tools can be subjective ...

* We focus on the tools that underpin what the majority of (tech) firms use

# Building an Analytics Toolkit

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/thinking.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

We assume you have a solid understanding of "intro stats" before taking this class 

* If you don't, re-think your decision to enroll this year
* OR put in the effort to acquire these skills in your own time

---

```

Why? 

* Purpose built statistical software
* Wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques
* Can do most analysis marketers need to do
* It's free and open source, and has a *friendly* user community
* Extremely useful in the job market and/or graduate study

# Motivation

**Strategic question:** Does adding personalized content improve email effectiveness?
  
* Personalized content $\rightarrow$ noninformative content

`r icons::fontawesome("rocket", style = "solid")` How would you design a experiment to answer this question?

How we're going to answer this question:

* Randomized Control Trial 
* Varies personalization & across contexts
* Evaluate effects using test of proportions & regression

# Why does this matter? 


* Most businesses engage in this practice 
* Email marketers have access to this information 
* Can impact consumer response via 'psychological mechanisms'

*Psychological mechanisms!?*

* [**A**] Drawing **a**ttention to the email 
* [**O**] Shape **o**pinions of reciever / positive cue
* [**E**] Increased **e**laboration ... via recipient processing

---
class: font160
# From 'Psychology' to Outcomes 

Different mechanisms $\rightarrow$ different patterns in outcome variables 

* Increased **opens** of personalized emails 
  * Consistent with A, O, E

* **Unsubscriptions** 
  * Increase under A, decrease under O and E

* **Leads**
  * increase under E and O ...
  * ... more evidence for E if even more leads when a discount mentioned

# Experiment 1: Design

# Experiment 4: Mechanisms

Identify whether mechanism related to: 

* **"increasing elaboration"**
  * noninformative content increases message processing 
* **"serving as a positive cue"** 
  * noninformative content increases the recipients liking of the advertiser.

* **A vs B**: adding name alone has no significant effect
* **B vs D**: adding name in presence of discount increases leads

* Cols 1 and 2 support ANOVA results
* Cols 3 to 6 show name increases enagement, discount decreases engagement

After completing DSMS you can ...

* Pose strategic questions important for digital markets
* Analyze data using "Gold Standard" techniques to answer the question posed using `R`
* Draw managerially relevant conclusion from digital marketing data
* Read and draw insight from modern academic literature

# Good and Bad News ...

**Good news**: high quality data driven solutions are incredibly useful

Why?

* Digital and Social Media impacts a wide variety of industries
  * Media & entertainment, politics, health care, FMCG, fashion & beauty, etc
* Digital Markets deliver a deluge of data
* It provides real answers to real problems in marketing and business strategy
  * And *people care about the answers*

* Being able to do (good) strategy relevant analytics ensures many (enjoyable) job prospects

---
class: font160

# Good and Bad News ...

**Bad News**: Its *hard*

* One needs to learn to use the right statistical tools
* ... **and** be able to work on causal (and predictive) questions
* ... while understanding the context of the problem at hand

(That seems like *a lot*...)

* And... learning the tools can be boring

**_Opinion_**: I think the upside far, far outweighs the bad.
