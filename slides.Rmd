# Textbooks & Readings

* **No Textbook** for the class
  * Become outdated fast as the digital space changes rapidly
  * Some emphasise too much of the hype, remainder are too dry
  * I do like Aral's *'Hype Machine'* though ... but its audience is not quite this class

* **My job**: filter through the sea of information and teach what is useful and relevant
  * No hype, hopefully not too dry

* **Your job**: read over assigned papers & articles, learn the skills
  * I've curated course content to (hopefully) deliver the most insight with the least technical details
  * Readings shouldn't be 'hype', occasionally dry
  * Skills acquired should be easy to transfer to a different problem

* Lecture slides will be on Canvas as PDFs before the lecture

# Things to Keep in Mind

* This course is **very new**
  * We look at *current* *knowledge*
  * There will likely be bugs ...
  * ... We'll work through them together

* Mix of students at various levels, from various backgrounds
  * Learn from other's unique perspectives

* I (awkwardly) straddle the line between marketing & economics
  * I care about 'mechanisms' and explaining why things happen
  * I care about more than only the 4P's
  * $\implies$ pragmatism towards analysis that answers interesting questions

**Marketing Strategy** refers to a firm's overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services

---
class: font160
# What this class is about!

**Digital and Social Media Strategies**: a game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers via digital technologies and social media

Need to propose **strategic questions** that can be answered 

* Can be answered $\implies$ can quantified with a number
* And the number needs to be credibly constructed ...
* ... from *correct* statistical analysis of the *right* data

---
class: font160
# Data Driven Answers

Good data-driven answers:

* Anchor on a decision to be made and/or a strategic question being asked 
* Find data for the purpose at hand
* Start from what is *unknown*
* **Empowers decision makers**

de Langhe and Puntoni (2020) call this "decision-driven analytics"

# Methods to Analyze Data

3 main ways to analyze data: 

1. **Descriptive Analysis**
  * For me, this includes Exploratory Analysis
2. **Causal Analysis** 
3. **Predictive Analysis** 

---
class: font160
# Descriptive Analysis

**Descriptive Analysis**: summarise characteristics of a data set

* What does the data look like?
  * Means, standard deviations distribution of data
  * Results are (stylised) *facts*

Examples:

* How are users who discuss a movie connected on Social Media?
* Is revenue attributed to clicks from Search Engines higher than last week?
* Has revenue growth from digital stores stayed high after COVID-19?

**We'll need to do some of this**

---
class: font160

# Causal Analysis

**Causal Analysis**: Does A lead to B?
  * Might also care about the mechanism of how it happens

Examples:

* Do Search Engine Ads increase product purchases?
* Does product promotion by influencers increase demand?
* Do push notifications work? In what way?

**We'll spend a lot of time in this space**

---
class: font160

# Predictive Analysis

**Predictive Analysis**: How can I best predict an outcome?
  * When A occurs, so does B

Examples:

* Is a review posted by a real person or by a bot?
* How many retweets does Nike expect its next tweet to get?
* Who is most likely to click on a digital ad?

**Not the focus of this class**

* Still matters, but time constraints!
* Other classes may touch on this

class: font160

# How to Deliver Data Driven Answers?

We want to deliver data driven insights to strategic questions

* Will need develop an analytics toolkit
  * Mainly statistical, building from existing knowledge 

* Stats backgrounds among students is heterogeneous
  * Principle: Leave no-one behind
    * Instructors are here to help catch you up and provide further guidance as needed
    * $\implies$ work with us, even when it is hard
    * Be willing to learn from each other, form study groups etc

---
class: font160

# Good and Bad News ...

**Good news**: high quality data driven solutions are incredibly useful

Why?

* Digital and Social Media impacts a wide variety of industries
  * Media & entertainment, politics, health care, FMCG, fashion & beauty, etc
* Digital Markets deliver a deluge of data
* It provides real answers to real problems in marketing and business strategy
  * And *people care about the answers*

* Being able to do (good) strategy relevant analytics ensures many (enjoyable) job prospects

---
class: font160

# Good and Bad News ...

**Bad News**: Its *hard*

* One needs to learn to use the right statistical tools
* ... **and** be able to work on causal (and predictive) questions
* ... while understanding the context of the problem at hand

(That seems like *a lot*...)

* And... learning the tools can be boring

**_Opinion_**: I think the upside far, far outweighs the bad.

# Understanding Key Features 

Delivering **good** answers to strategic questions $\implies$ understanding the context 

Context includes:

* What does a given marketplace look like? (who are the actors? what are the rules?)
* How does the market work? (what decisions? by whom?)
* How has the market evolved? (is it growing? how much? has this lead to changes? why?)
* Where is there room to optimize business / consumer decisions strategically?

Lectures will introduce this context across the markets we discuss

---
class: font150
# Building an Analytics Toolkit

Delivering **good** _data driven_ answers to strategic questions $\implies$ using the right statistical techniques 

* ANOVA 
* A/B Tests and Experimentation
* Linear regression & interpreting the results _carefully_

The 'right' tools can be subjective ...

* We focus on the tools the majority of firms use

---
class: font150
# Building an Analytics Toolkit: Software

Weapon of Choice: `R` - purpose built statistical software

* Wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques
* Can do most analysis marketers need to do
* It's free and open source, and has a *friendly* user community
* Extremely useful in the job market and/or graduate study
