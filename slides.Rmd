```

**Digital Marketing**: Marketing of products or services using digital technologies, mainly on the Internet, but also including mobile phones, display advertising and any other digital medium (Wikipedia)

**Social media marketing** is the process of creating (tailored) content to drive engagement, promote a business and generate revenue.

knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Digital and Social Media Strategies**: understanding how to reach and engage with consumers via digital technologies and social media

Managers propose **strategic questions** that need to be answered 

* Needs be answered $\implies$ can be **quantified with a number**
* And the number needs to be **credibly constructed** ...
* ... from **correct statistical analysis** of the **right data**

$\implies$ this course has a *substantial* quantitative component

Tips for success:

* Set "expectations" early -- course standards are the minimum
* Everyone has different skills they are good at, utilize this (but don't abuse it!)
* Important communication via email/Canvas Groups rather than WhatsApp/Signal etc
* Plan to be done in advance of deadlines
* Don't be silent

# Textbooks & Readings

* **No Textbook** for the class
  * Become outdated fast as the digital space changes rapidly
  * Some emphasise too much of the hype, remainder are too dry
  * I do like Aral's *'Hype Machine'* though ... but its audience is not quite this class

* **Our job**: filter through the sea of information and teach what is useful and relevant
  * No hype, hopefully not too dry

* **Your job**: read over assigned papers & articles, learn the skills
  * We've curated course content to (hopefully) deliver the most insight with the least technical details
  * Readings shouldn't be 'hype', occasionally dry
  * Skills acquired should be easy to transfer to a different problem

* Course content will be on Canvas as PDFs before class

# Building an Analytics Toolkit

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="20%"}
url <- "figs/toolkit.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Delivering **good** _data driven_ answers to strategic questions $\implies$ using the right statistical techniques 

* ANOVA 
* A/B Tests and Experimentation
* Linear regression 
* Interpreting the results _carefully_

The 'right' tools can be subjective ...

* We focus on the tools that underpin what the majority of (tech) firms use

---
class: font150
# Building an Analytics Toolkit

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
url <- "figs/thinking.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

We assume you have a solid understanding of "intro stats" before taking this class 

* If you don't, re-think your decision to enroll this year
* OR put in the effort to acquire these skills in your own time

---
class: font150
# Building an Analytics Toolkit with R

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="30%"}
url <- "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/1920px-R_logo.svg.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Why? 

* Purpose built statistical software
* Wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques
* Can do most analysis marketers need to do
* It's free and open source, and has a *friendly* user community
* Extremely useful in the job market and/or graduate study

# Things to Keep in Mind

* This course is **very new** and **evolving**
  * We look at *current* *knowledge*
  * There will likely be bugs ...
  * ... We'll work through them together

* Mix of students at various levels, from various backgrounds
  * Learn from other's unique perspectives

* I (awkwardly) straddle the line between marketing & economics
  * I care about 'mechanisms' and explaining why things happen
  * I care about more than only the 4P's
  * $\implies$ pragmatism towards analysis that answers interesting questions

# Methods to Analyze Data

3 main ways to analyze data: 

1. **Descriptive Analysis**
  * For me, this includes Exploratory Analysis
2. **Causal Analysis** 
3. **Predictive Analysis** 

---
class: font160
# Descriptive Analysis

**Descriptive Analysis**: summarise characteristics of a data set

* What does the data look like?
  * Means, standard deviations distribution of data
  * Results are (stylised) *facts*

Examples:

* How are users who discuss a movie connected on Social Media?
* Is revenue attributed to clicks from Search Engines higher than last week?
* Has revenue growth from digital stores stayed high after COVID-19?

**We'll need to do some of this**

---
class: font160

# Causal Analysis

**Causal Analysis**: Does A lead to B?
  * Might also care about the mechanism of how it happens

Examples:

* Do Search Engine Ads increase product purchases?
* Does product promotion by influencers increase demand?
* Do push notifications work? In what way?

**We'll spend a lot of time in this space**


---
class: font150
# Causal Data Driven Marketing

> What is the impact of an marketing intervention (X) on an outcome (Y)

1. Hard to evaluate
2. Need to compute counterfactuals
3. Challenge: same person cannot both get treatment and not get treatment

We'll get back to these issues often so don't worry if this sounds complicated right now

# Predictive Analysis

**Predictive Analysis**: How can I best predict an outcome?
  * When A occurs, so does B

Examples:

* Is a review posted by a real person or by a bot?
* How many retweets does Nike expect its next tweet to get?
* Who is most likely to click on a digital ad?

**Not the focus of this class**

* Still matters, but time constraints!
* Other classes may touch on this

# Good and Bad News ...

**Good news**: high quality data driven solutions are incredibly useful

Why?

* Digital and Social Media impacts a wide variety of industries
  * Media & entertainment, politics, health care, FMCG, fashion & beauty, etc
* Digital Markets deliver a deluge of data
* It provides real answers to real problems in marketing and business strategy
  * And *people care about the answers*

* Being able to do (good) strategy relevant analytics ensures many (enjoyable) job prospects

---
class: font160

# Good and Bad News ...

**Bad News**: Its *hard*

* One needs to learn to use the right statistical tools
* ... **and** be able to work on causal (and predictive) questions
* ... while understanding the context of the problem at hand

(That seems like *a lot*...)

* And... learning the tools can be boring

**_Opinion_**: I think the upside far, far outweighs the bad.
